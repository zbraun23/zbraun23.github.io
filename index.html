                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p><strong>Eli</strong> decided to leave Hakuba early because he had had enough of the snow. I was determined to stay even though the conditions were poor, so <em>Zac</em> and I continued to hit the slopes. Our last 2 days in Hakuba were a blizzard.</p>
                        <p>We went over to the back side of the mountain which was much less touched and actually found some amazing powder. One of the days we went into a nice, new cafe place and had soup. It was freezing but we still had an awesome time together on the mountain and then onsenning at the ryokan.</p>

                        <p>My Booger <em>Lauren Ross</em> and I met when she arrived in Hakuba at 2am. I greeted her and the front door of our Ryokan. We were so excited to see each other and begin our journey together around Japan and it started in the snow!</p>
                        <p>We snuck into the room in which <strong><em>Elijah Swart</em></strong> slept and had ourselves a good ol' fashion cuddle before waking early to grab her some ski gear from the rental place across the road. We got a great discount. Eli was a dumb spud thinking it would be a good idea to rent ski's instead of a board. He did 1 run. The snow was icy but we had a great time! <a href="https://www.hakubaskikan.com/en-us">Click here to see our accomodation.</a></p>
